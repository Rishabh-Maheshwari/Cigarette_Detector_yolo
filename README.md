Developing a cigarette detector model using YOLO algorithm from scracth.
# Deep learning based Cigarette detection using the YOLOv3 algorithm


## Getting started

The YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. The published model recognizes 80 different objects in images and videos. For more details, you can refer to this [paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf).
